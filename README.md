This is a repository containing some of my favorite LLMs projects.
# Large Language Models â€“ README

Welcome to my Large Language Models (LLMs) repository. This project explores the architecture, fine-tuning, and deployment of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT, BERT, and LLaMA. It includes code samples, model training notebooks, evaluation metrics, and inference pipelines for text generation, summarization, and question answering tasks. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical applications of LLMs in natural language processing while highlighting optimization strategies for performance and cost efficiency. Each module is documented for easy understanding and reproducibility. Researchers, developers, and students can use this repository to learn, experiment, and build their own advanced NLP systems. Contributions, discussions, and improvements are welcome to make this repository a valuable learning resource for the AI community.
